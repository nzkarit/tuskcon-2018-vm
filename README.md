# Tuskcon 2018 - ADS-B workshop
This repo contains instructions and links for [my](https://twitter.com/nzkarit) workshop at [Tuskcon](http://tuskcon.org/#program) 2018.

The [setup.md](https://github.com/nzkarit/tuskcon-2018-vm/blob/master/setup.md) file is how to get everything installed. I am planning to bring pre built VM, so these are for reference and shouldn't be needed during the workshop.

The [running.md](https://github.com/nzkarit/tuskcon-2018-vm/blob/master/running.md) file contains all the commands etc which will be helpful during the workshop, so you can copy and paste and not have to read from projector.
