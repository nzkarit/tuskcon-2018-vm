# Tuskcon 2018 - ADS-B workshop
This repo contains instructions and links for [my](https://twitter.com/nzkarit) workshop at [Tuskcon](http://tuskcon.org/#program) 2018. It leverages [my fork of ADSB-Out](https://github.com/nzkarit/ADSB-Out) code which was originally written by [lyusupov](https://github.com/lyusupov/ADSB-Out).

The [setup.md](https://github.com/nzkarit/tuskcon-2018-vm/blob/master/setup.md) file is how to get everything installed. I am planning to bring pre built VM, so these are for reference and shouldn't be needed during the workshop. Though you can use these build your own VM

The [running.md](https://github.com/nzkarit/tuskcon-2018-vm/blob/master/running.md) file contains all the commands etc which will be helpful during the workshop, so you can copy and paste and not have to read from projector.

For Tuskcon I have put a [preconfigured VM](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oIs01Pma_5cCD2O2yjfDhq82-Qgdy432/view?usp=sharing) up which is ready to go (basically everything from setup.md) if you would like to use that. It will disappear sometime after the con.

My [slides from Tuskcon are available](https://zxsecurity.co.nz/presentations/201805_TuskCon-ZXSecurity-ADSBSDRWorkshop.pdf).

If you have an RTLSDR you can do the listening parts and with a HackRF you can do the broadcast parts.
